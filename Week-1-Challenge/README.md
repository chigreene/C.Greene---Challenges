#Challenge Number 1 - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The project goal is to take provided code and refractor the existing code so it is uses sematic elements properly and to make the code more eloquent. I did this by making sure the code is properly organized, non-repetitive, condensed, and commenting on any changes I made.  These changes improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.

-My motivation was to create code that meets best practice guidelines, is more accessible through the proper use of semantics, and creates less confusing code to read.
-I built this project to show that the code I was given could be cleaned up to be more eloquent and properly use semantics to meet accessability criteria.
-The changes i made to the code solved the issue that the original code did not use semantics, was unorganized, and repetitive. 
-What i learned is code can be condensed by using common classes when appropriate. Not using proper semantic code makes it difficult to read and understand. Finally, I learned that css code and html code should follow the same general flow. What is first in the HTML should not be last in css unless necessary.
