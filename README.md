# Challenge Number 1 - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

The project goal is to take provided code and refractor the existing code so it is uses sematic elements properly and to make the code more eloquent. I did this by making sure the code is properly organized, non-repetitive, condensed, and by commenting on any changes I made.  I also sought to add some comments explaining the role of elements in the code. These changes improve the codebase for long-term sustainability.

-My motivation was to create code that meets best practice guidelines, is more accessible through the proper use of semantics, and creates less confusing code to read. Also some errors in the code were corrected without changing functionality.
-I built this project to show that the code I was given could be cleaned up to be more eloquent and properly use semantics to meet accessability criteria.
-The changes I made to the code solved the issue that the original code did not use semantics, was unorganized, and repetitive. The changes also fixed some errors in the links.
-What I learned is code can be condensed by using common classes when appropriate. Not using proper semantic code makes it difficult to read and understand. Finally, I learned that css code and html code should follow the same general flow. What is first in the HTML should not be last in css unless necessary.
